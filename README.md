# The Library Is Open! 💃🏼

![A GIF of RuPaul Charles saying: Because reading is what? Fundamental!](TheLibraryIsOpen/Recursos/reading-is-fundamental.gif)

This is meant as a celebration of how open podcasts (used to) be.

Download your favorites before the big bad takes them (I'm talking about at you, Spotify).
